## üì¶ Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21
- Maven 3.x
- MySQL Server
- Keycloak (for authentication, or configure for local testing without it)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd masjedi
    ```

2.  **Configure Database**:
    - Create a MySQL database named `masjedi_db`.
    - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database credentials:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/masjedi_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.username=[your_mysql_username]
    spring.datasource.password=[your_mysql_password]
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    ```

3.  **Configure Keycloak (Optional, for full security features)**:
    - Set up a Keycloak realm and client.
    - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your Keycloak configuration:
    ```properties
    spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=[your_keycloak_issuer_uri]
    spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=[your_keycloak_jwk_set_uri]
    ```
    For local development without Keycloak, you might need to adjust `SecurityConfig.java` or use a simpler authentication mechanism.

4.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

To run the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## üìñ API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger UI. Once the application is running, navigate to:
